For decades the Austro-Hungarian empire had been a powerful influence in the heart of Europe
Resting on a legacy, their house kept stability, order and peace 
But not everyone bowed to this power.

In the summer of 1914 the archduke Franz Ferdinand of the empire
is visiting Sarajevo, unaware of the assassins awaiting him, and what will come.

Two shots are fired and the Archduke is dead.

The empire cannot let this go unpunished, and the first declaration of war is made.

Chaos and shockwaves spread from the Balkans across the globe.
Alliances are put to the test, threats exchanged and armies are put on high alert.
In the east the Russian Tsar is trying to calm the situation with his cousin, the Kaiser of Germany.

But it is all in vain, the situation is out of control, War is unavoidable.

The Battle of the Frontiers starts in August as soldiers cross borders and bullets are fired in rage.

War begins!
